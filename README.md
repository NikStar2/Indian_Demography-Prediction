# Indian_Demography-Prediction
This project helps people who are new to Machine Learning and are trying to do prediction.The project is based on Machine learning algorithm "Polynomial regression".
Polynomial regression is a process of finding a polynomial function that takes the form f( x ) = c0 + c1 x + c2 x2 â‹¯ cn xn where n is the degree of the polynomial and c is a set of coefficients. Through polynomial regression we try to find an nth degree polynomial function which is the closest approximation of our data points.
Other than that we have also used basic machine learning libraries like mathplotlib,pandas and numpy.

The project is Divided into two halves-
# 1.Machine Learning
# 2.Web Development
What I basically did is that I took the images and code of the visualization and predictions then posted them in a webpage with login and signup options.I am not gonna go in detail about the web part but we have used Tomcat server to run the server. All the files and image needed to run the website are uploaded.

# Machine learning 
In this part we have done 2 things-


1.I visualized the population demography of India for the years 2001 and 2011.


2.I have predicted the population of india from the year 2011 to 2030.

For the visualization part I used the matplotlib library,before this the data of the population demography of india of the year 2001 and 2011 were taken and cleaned.
For the Prediction i used Polynomial Regression and the data sets were cleaned and then used.Before using Polynomial Regression I used Linear Regression and then checked the accuracy ratio with Polynomial Regression then came to a conclusion that Polynomial Regression has much better accuracy than that of Linear Regression.
# All the data sets have been taken from kaggle and also have been uploaded here.
